*Expense Tracker + Chat Assistant*
This project is a SwiftIU app based on a simple RAG system that integrates:

Realm for local data persistence,
A chat interface for interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM) via asynchronous network requests.
Receipt and financial data recognition with a VLM, and possibility of refining the recognition with user action.
The user can enter queries about their financial transactions. The assistant may instruct the app to perform database queries (filtering, summing, etc.) and then provide a final response.
